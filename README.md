Passivity-based Whole-Body Control control. 

Simulate a humanoid controlled via Model Predictive control. 
The project should modify the he provided humanoid whole body controller with the passivity-based one.

## üîß Setup & Requirements

You need Python (preferably 3.11 or 3.12) and the following dependencies:

Many packages are shared with this repo:  
üîó [https://github.com/DIAG-Robotics-Lab/ismpc](https://github.com/DIAG-Robotics-Lab/ismpc/blob/main/README.md)

**Important version constraints:**
- `numpy==1.26.0`
- `pin==2.7.0` (higher versions may be incompatible with `dartpy` / `cmeel-boost`/'numpy)
- `dartpy==0.2.0` (you may need Python 3.12 to install it correctly)

### Install using pip

```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.0
pip install dartpy casadi scipy matplotlib osqp
pip install pin==2.7.0
```
In additional (not mandatory) if want to use meshcat viosualization also run 
```
pip install meshcat
```

For more detail see the requirement.tx file or if you are using a virtual enveiroment you could just run 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the simulation
```
python3 project/simulation.py
```
then press spacebar to start it
