1/ Briefly go through the structure of the code

In inverse_dynamic.py file
--> Done
2/ Discuss about the gain implementation?

Do we need to invlove the value of M_k?
-->Ask Elisa

3/ Any idea of reducing the multiple calling of compute_task_space_matrices(J[task], M) 

Computed MK as stack of M_k and store in a specific way to use it later??
--> Alensandro will investigate it -> When (1-2 days from now)

4/ Idea of the expriment to collect the data for the report

Currently has an external push (while walking and while standing, collect the CoM curve)
Create an uneven terrain!
Idea: Weird Environment, a box!!
Create an objet, and put it on the floor! (shape of the box TBD?)
Then tune the gain of the controler (D_k, K_k) to achieve different environment

--> Explore the way to create the environment together

Compare with the given controller

5/ Discuss about the report.
--> An: Sketch the outline of the report first => send out end of this week
